vtkfox
======

FOX/VTK canvas widget and interactor to allow VTK to interact with your FOX
application. Allows VTK to render inside a FOX application via the FXGLCanvas
control. Keyboard and mouse events are translated to allow for "native" VTK
functionality.

The code was originally developed at http://sourceforge.net/projects/vtkfox/
by Doug Henry, who has been kind enough to hand it over to me.
